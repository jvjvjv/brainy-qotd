# Brainy QOTD

A little script that grabs today's Brainy Quote and saves it locally.

**CURRENT STATUS: NOT WORKING**

## Reason

I just wanted to document why this simple node application was made for now. I'll go through and elaborate on this small project with proper documentation when I can.

Sometimes working on a product can get stressful, and one day while working at Dossier I noticed that, at least for me, just visiting the site would provide some inspiration and help me get through the day. At some point, I started sharing the daily quote every morning before or after our daily standup.

This at least automated the collection of the day's quote. While my goal was to ultimately make this a CLI that would copy the quote image and paste it directly in a meeting chat, that ultimately did not happen. But this artifact remains of the time I brought a little inspiration to the workplace.
